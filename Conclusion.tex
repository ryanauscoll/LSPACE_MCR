Team 18's mission concept outlines a realistic and technically grounded approach to detecting and characterizing subsurface water ice on Mars—an essential step toward enabling future human exploration. By combining proven instruments such as ground-penetrating radar, neutron spectroscopy, and onboard spectrometers with a small astrobiology experiment, the proposed rover system directly supports both the latest Decadal Survey science priorities and NASA’s long-term exploration goals.\\

The next key milestone in the project is the System Requirements Review (SRR), which will evaluate whether the mission requirements are clearly defined, achievable, and aligned with stakeholder objectives. This review is an important step before entering the design phase, as it ensures that all major technical and operational needs are understood and that the team is on a solid footing moving forward.\\

In the coming weeks, the team will refine subsystem-level requirements—covering mechanical, thermal, electrical, and scientific payload elements. Finalizing the landing site using JMARS datasets, confirming instrument configurations, and closing out any remaining TBDs in the Science Traceability Matrix are also top priorities. If given additional time and resources, the team plans to conduct expanded trade studies, refine mobility system designs, and develop more detailed operational scenarios for the astrobiology payload.
