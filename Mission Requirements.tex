\section*{1.4 Mission Requirements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{1.4 Mission Requirements}

The mission requirements are derived directly from the science and exploration objectives, the customer-imposed constraints outlined in the Mission Task Document, and the environmental conditions expected on the Martian surface. These requirements serve as concrete, measurable benchmarks for mission success and help define the design envelope for each subsystem.
\\
To meet its objectives, the mission must balance scientific return with strict engineering limitations, including mass, volume, power architecture, and cost. The rover must operate within a 10 km $\times$ 10 km Exploration Zone (EZ), collect high-confidence in situ data, and return information relevant to both scientific discovery and human exploration readiness. The inclusion of an astrobiology payload further introduces planetary protection considerations and strict volume/mass allocations.\\

The detailed system-level requirements are enumerated in the table below, each mapped to a rationale, parent and child dependencies, verification method, and whether the requirement is currently met.
