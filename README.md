## 📄 Project Overview

Team Vitalis is developing a robotic mission concept to explore the northern mid-latitudes of Mars, with a focus on identifying near-surface water ice deposits. This mission supports astrobiology science goals and future human exploration by locating accessible ice and characterizing local hazards, terrain, and volatile-rich features.

## 🛰️ Mission Objectives

- Detect and characterize water ice within 0–1 meter of the surface.
- Investigate geomorphological features related to past or present water activity.
- Support in situ resource utilization (ISRU) planning for future crewed missions.
- Maintain planetary protection standards in compliance with COSPAR Category IV requirements.
